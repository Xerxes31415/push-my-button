# Push My Button Electronics

## Version 1

This was a purely prototype version with almost no customization.  It used the [Adafruit ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT Feather](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5345) and the [PropMaker Featherwing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3988) for the electronics. The battery was a single Li-Ion 2500mAh pouch cell.  

## Version Next

* Maintain the ESP32-S2, though might move to a different ESP32, depending on features and current draw.  
* Integrate everything into a single board.
